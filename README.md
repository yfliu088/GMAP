# GMAP
GMAP is a program to perform morphology analysis of irregular particles. It includes the SEMD algorithm to conduct the scale decomposition and the calculation of morphology characterization descriptors. The essence of the GMAP is a MATLAB function package. This program is mainly composed of four parts (subfolders), namely ‘preprocess’, ‘scaledecomp’, ‘descriptor’ and ‘addfunc’. Among them, part ‘preprocess’ refers to preprocessing, which is used to convert various morphology data into surface Fibonacci triangular mesh. Part ‘scaledecomp’ refers to scale decomposition, which is used to carry out SEMD algorithm and three-level decomposition. Part ‘descriptor’ can calculate all the morphology descriptors mentioned in the paper. Part ‘addfunc’ includes several additional functions, which are plot functions, spherical harmonic transform functions and particle generate functions.
